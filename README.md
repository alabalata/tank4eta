A small BattleCity like game I am building for fun. It is written in Python 2. It should be easy to port it to python 3 at some point in the future.

### How to Run

First, make sure you have PyGame 1.* installed. The game can be started with `python app.py`. All assets you would need are included in the repo.

### Credits

In creating this I've used the following open parts:

* The [PyGame engine](http://www.pygame.org/)
* [Ubuntu font](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/)
* Scott Barlow's excellent [menu library](https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-pygame-menu-class/)
